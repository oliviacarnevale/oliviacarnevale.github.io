    "section": "",
    "text": "Former Ohio State quarterback C.J. Stroud had a successful career with the Buckeyes, winning a Rose Bowl in 2021, leading his team to the College Football Playoff in 2022, and remains a top prospect in the 2023 NFL Draft. One accomplishment he didn’t acquire: a Heisman Trophy.\nIn his two years as a starting quarterback at Ohio State, Stroud was nominated twice as a Heisman Trophy Finalist. In 2021, he finished fourth in voting behind Alabama quarterback Bryce Young, Michigan defensive lineman Aiden Hutchinson and Pitt quarterback Kenny Pickett. Again, in 2022, Stroud failed to get enough votes to win placing third behind USC quarterback Caleb Williams and TCU quarterback Max Duggan, but just ahead of Georgia quarterback Stetson Bennett. \nShould Stroud have finished so low in comparison to the other five quarterbacks in the respective Heisman races? \nLet’s start by looking at his passing statistics in both the 2021 and 2022 seasons.\nStroud’s completion percentage shows how accurate he was in both college football seasons. In 2022, he was in the middle of the pack in Heisman finalists, but in 2021, he was far out in front of any other Heisman finalist from either year. \nThe closest finalist to him in the two-year span of completion percentage? The one quarterback who finished behind him in 2022, Stetson Bennett. The 2021 winner? Bryce Young, a whole five percent lower than him in completion percentage.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\none <- read_csv(\"2021passingstats.csv\") %>%\n  mutate(\n    Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE),\n        Season = 2021, \n    PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season)\n    )\n\ntwo <- read_csv(\"2022passingstats.csv\") %>% \n  mutate(\n    Player = gsub(\"*\", \"\", Player, fixed=TRUE), \n    Season = 2022, \n        PlayerSeason = paste(Player, Season)\n    )\n\nboth <- bind_rows(one, two)\n\nheisman <- c(\"Bryce Young 2021\", \"C.J.

Let’s dive further into Stroud’s passing statistics in relation to touchdowns and interceptions. \nIn both 2021 and 2022 Stroud finished just below the respective year’s Heisman winner in passing touchdown to interception ratio. However, in 2021, Bryce Young’s end-of-season seven interceptions is almost identical to Stroud’s six. In fact, Young’s three more touchdowns came from playing three more games, and the Heisman race is decided before postseason play.\n\n\nCode\ntdint <- both %>% filter(PlayerSeason %in% heisman) %>% \n  select(PlayerSeason, PassingTD, Int)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=tdint, \n    aes(y=reorder(PlayerSeason, PassingTD), x=PassingTD, xend=Int),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"darkgreen\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Young's TD:Int ratio was better...but he played 3 more games\", \n    subtitle = \"The farther to the right <span style = 'color:red;'>interceptions</span> and <span style = 'color:darkgreen;'>passing touchdowns</span> are, the better.\",\n    x=\"Interceptions vs Passing Touchdowns\",\n    y=\"\",\n    caption= \"Source: Sports Reference | By Olivia Carnevale\"\n  ) +\n    theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple(), \n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021 Stroud seemed as though he should have been at the top of the argument for the most accurate and highest scoring regular-season quarterback in college football, but what about yards?\nAgain, in 2021 Stroud finished far in front of the Heisman pack, including his own 2022 stats, in passing yards per game, but struggled in rushing yards per game. Who else struggled rushing? Bryce Young, the 2021 Heisman winner.\n\n\nCode\npassingyds <- both %>% filter(PlayerSeason %in% heisman) %>% \n  select(PlayerSeason, PassingYds, G) \n\nrushingyds <- both %>% filter(PlayerSeason %in% heisman) %>% \n  select(PlayerSeason, RushingYds, G) \n\npydsperg <- passingyds %>%\n  mutate(\n    pyardspergame = PassingYds/G\n  ) \n\nrydsperg <- rushingyds %>%\n  mutate(\n    ryardspergame = RushingYds/G\n  ) \n\npcj1 <- pydsperg %>% filter(PlayerSeason == \"C.J.

Did he again deserve to finish so low in Heisman voting?\nIn both 2021 and 2022 Stroud led his conference and both years’ Heisman finalists in passing touchdowns per game.\n\n\nCode\nset.seed(1234)\n\nptd <- both %>%\n  mutate(\n    passtdpergame = PassingTD/G\n  ) \n\ntd <- ptd %>% filter(PlayerSeason %in% heisman) %>% \n  select(PlayerSeason, passtdpergame, Conf) \n\ncj1 <- td %>% filter(PlayerSeason == \"C.J.

Stroud appeared to be one of, if not the best, passers in college football. Yet he finished fourth and third in Heisman voting over his two years starting at Ohio State.\nThese statistics prompt the question, did Stroud put on a Heisman-deserving performance at either year at Ohio State? Specific to his 2021 statistics, was Stroud robbed of the Heisman in 2021 after putting on such great passing performances, better performances than even Bryce Young?\nThat’s up to you."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Justin Jefferson. Ja’Marr Chase. LSU. WRU. As a, let’s say, mild, Ohio State and Packers fan, hearing those names, that school, that argument every time I watch a football-related show is grating on my ears. But who really is the modern WRU? Am I petty, is it actually the Tigers with recent outputs like Jefferson and Chase? I went into this willing to get my feelings hurt, this time, of my own doing, but let’s see how it went. \nFirst, what teams deserve to be in this argument? For this, I looked at the number of draft picks by the top schools, specifically in rounds one through three, since the year 2000. \nWho are the WRU-conversation-worthy teams? Ohio State, LSU, USC, Oklahoma, Florida and Alabama. And to my (pleasant) surprise, LSU isn’t on top, Ohio State is thanks to Jaxon Smith-Njigba’s first-round selection by the Seattle Seahawks (count one of hurt feelings for me) just over a week ago. \n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\ndraft23 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2023\n)\n\ndraft22 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2022\n)\n\ndraft21 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2021\n)\n\ndraft20 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2020\n)\n\ndraft19 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2019\n)\n\ndraft18 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2018\n)\n\ndraft17 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2017\n)\n\ndraft16 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2016\n)\n\ndraft15 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2015\n)\n\ndraft14 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2014\n)\n\ndraft13 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2013\n)\n\ndraft12 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2012\n)\n\ndraft11 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2011\n)\n\ndraft10 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2010\n)\n\ndraft09 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2009\n)\n\ndraft08 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2008\n)\n\ndraft07 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2007\n)\n\ndraft06 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2006\n)\n\ndraft05 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2005\n)\n\ndraft04 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2004\n)\n\ndraft03 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2003\n)\n\ndraft02 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2002\n)\n\ndraft01 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2001\n)\n\ndraft00 <- cfbd_draft_picks(\n  year = 2000\n)\n\ndraft <- bind_rows(draft23, draft22, draft21, draft20, draft19, draft18, draft17, draft16, draft15, draft14, draft13, draft12, draft11, draft10, draft09, draft08, draft07, draft06, draft05, draft04, draft03, draft02, draft01, draft00)\n\nteamlist <- draft %>%\n  filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\") %>%\n  filter(round <=3) %>%\n  group_by(college_team) %>% \n  tally(sort=TRUE) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  top_n(10, wt=n) %>%\n  pull(college_team)\n\nteamorder <- draft %>%\n  filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\") %>%\n  filter(round <=3) %>%\n  group_by(college_team) %>% \n  tally(sort=TRUE) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  rename(order = n) %>%\n  top_n(10, wt=order)\n\nstacked <- draft %>%\n  filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\") %>%\n  filter(round <=3) %>%\n  filter(college_team %in% teamlist) %>%\n  group_by(college_team, round) %>% \n  tally() %>%\n  arrange(college_team) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(round = as.factor(round))\n\nstacked <- stacked %>% inner_join(teamorder)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=stacked, aes(x=reorder(college_team, order), weight=n, fill=round)) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#90A7F9\", \"#3756C7\", \"#1F3054\")) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Total Number of WR Drafted\",\n    title=\"Since 2000 OSU has the most WR drafted in the first three rounds\", \n    subtitle=\"The first 5 teams' picks are somewhat evenly distributed, but Alabama WRs dominate the first round.\",\n caption= \"Source: College Football Fast R | By Olivia Carnevale\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15.5, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we know what teams produce draft picks, what have these picks done once in the NFL? Let’s zoom in a little bit. Sure, the Buckeyes may have the most top round picks since 2000, but what about recently? What about these receivers’ NFL production? To determine this, we will shift our focus to the past five years and to season total yards.\nTo understand how these teams developed their wide receivers, we also will focus on rookie numbers: what school produces the most NFL-ready wide receivers? Bringing yards into it, we will look at which school’s wide receivers average the most yards their rookie seasons and how that stacks up to the average NFL rookie. Again, Ohio State’s on top due to consistent quantity, but with USC narrowly behind.\n\n\nCode\nwr22 <- read_csv(\"wr2022.csv\")\n\nwr21 <- read_csv(\"wr2021.csv\")\n\nwr20 <- read_csv(\"wr2020.csv\")\n\nwr19 <- read_csv(\"wr2019.csv\")\n\nwr18 <- read_csv(\"wr2018.csv\")\n\n\nwrdraft22 <- draft22 %>% filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\")\n\nwrdraft21 <- draft21 %>% filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\")\n\nwrdraft20 <- draft20 %>% filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\")\n\nwrdraft19 <- draft19 %>% filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\")\n\nwrdraft18 <- draft18 %>% filter(position == \"Wide Receiver\")\n\n\ndraftnflcombined22 <- wrdraft22 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined21 <- wrdraft21 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined20 <- wrdraft20 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined19 <- wrdraft19 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined18 <- wrdraft18 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined <- bind_rows(draftnflcombined22, draftnflcombined21, draftnflcombined20, draftnflcombined19, draftnflcombined18)\n\n\nteams <- c(\"LSU\", \"Ohio State\", \"USC\", \"Alabama\", \"Florida\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Tennessee\", \"Penn State\", \"Michigan\", \"Miami\", \"Clemson\")\n\nwrteams <- draftnflcombined %>% filter(college_team %in% teams)\n\nwrteamaverage <- wrteams %>% filter(Yds > 0) %>%\n  group_by(college_team) %>%\n  summarize(\n    avgyds = mean(Yds)\n  )\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=wrteamaverage, aes(x=reorder(college_team, avgyds), weight=avgyds, fill=college_team)) + \n  geom_hline(yintercept=412.3761, color=\"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=2.5, y=550, label=\"Average NFL Rookie\"), color=\"black\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#9E1B32\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"#461D7C\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\", \"#BB0000\",\"#841617\", \"lightgrey\", \"lightgrey\",\"#FFC72C\")) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Average Rookie Recieving Yards\",\n    title=\"Recent OSU WRs average the most yards in their rookie seasons\", \n    subtitle=\"In the past 5 years' WR rookie classes, OSU's surpass other WR powerhouses, highlighted below, in rec yards.\",\n caption= \"Sources: College Football Fast R, Sports Reference | By Olivia Carnevale\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15.4, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\nSo, the Buckeyes may produce a high quantity of the most consistently strong average NFL rookie wide receivers. But who has the biggest stars, the biggest standouts? This leads us back to Jefferson and Chase. This leads us to look at the wide receivers with the most outstanding per game metrics in their rookie seasons, again, in relation to the average rookie. \nTo no surprise, Jefferson and Chase are far out in front; they are the modern superstars. However, LSU isn’t the only school that produces standout wide receivers, each top team in the conversation defined earlier, except Florida, has at least one great rookie from the past five years. \nLSU may have two far in front, one better in yards per game, the other in touchdowns per game, but the Crimson Tide’s are close and the Buckeyes even tighter, both producing consistent, balanced outputs. \nIn addition, there are only two schools to produce a wide receiver NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in this time period: LSU and Ohio State.\n\n\nCode\ndraftnflcombined22 <- wrdraft22 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined21 <- wrdraft21 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined20 <- wrdraft20 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined19 <- wrdraft19 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined18 <- wrdraft18 %>% left_join(wr22, by=c(\"name\" = \"Player\"))\n\ndraftnflcombined <- bind_rows(draftnflcombined22, draftnflcombined21, draftnflcombined20, draftnflcombined19, draftnflcombined18)%>% \n  mutate(\n    playerteam = paste(name, college_team)\n    )\n\nnew <- draftnflcombined %>% filter(Yds > 0, TD > 0, G > 0) %>% \n   mutate(\n    yg = Yds/G,\n    tdg = TD/G\n   ) \n\nteams <- c(\"LSU\", \"Ohio State\", \"USC\", \"Alabama\", \"Florida\", \"Oklahoma\", \"Tennessee\", \"Penn State\", \"Michigan\", \"Miami\", \"Clemson\")\n\nwrteam <- draftnflcombined %>% filter(college_team %in% teams)\n\nwrname <- wrteam %>% filter(Yds > 0, TD > 0, G > 0) %>% \n   mutate(\n    yg = Yds/G, \n    tdg = TD/G\n  ) %>% \n  group_by(playerteam) %>%\n  summarize(\n    tdg = (tdg),\n    yg = (yg)\n  )\n\nwrtop <- wrteam %>% \n     mutate(\n    yg = Yds/G,\n    tdg = TD/G\n  ) %>% \n  filter(yg > 60, tdg > .23, G > 0) %>%\n  group_by(playerteam) %>%\n  summarize(\n    tdg = (tdg),\n    yg = (yg)\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=new, \n    aes(x=tdg, y=yg), color=\"lightgrey\") + \n  geom_vline(xintercept=0.2375367, color = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=39.75049, color = \"darkgrey\") +\n  geom_point(\n    data=draftnflcombined, \n    aes(x=0.2375367, y=39.75049), color=\"red\") +\n    geom_text(aes(x=0.248, y=44, label=\"Average NFL Rookie\"), color=\"red\", size=3) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=wrtop, \n    aes(x=tdg, y=yg), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=.525, y=107, label=\"Jefferson (LSU)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.591, y=80, label=\"Lamb (Oklahoma)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.74, y=92, label=\"*Chase (LSU)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.465, y=84, label=\"Waddle (Alabama)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.5, y=64.5, label=\"Higgins (Clemson)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.47, y=70.5, label=\"Smith (Alabama)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.38, y=76.7, label=\"Brown (USC)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.35, y=69.5, label=\"McLaurin (OSU)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.39, y=61, label=\"Jeudy (Alabama)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.24, y=73.5, label=\"Olave (OSU)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.234, y=61, label=\"*Wilson (OSU)\"), color=\"black\", size=3) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.66, y=3, label=\"* = NFL offensive rookie of the year\"), color=\"black\", size=3)  +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Rookie Touchdowns per Game\", \n    y=\" Rookie Yards per Game\",\n    title=\"Recent Alabama, OSU and LSU rookie classes include standouts\", \n    subtitle=\"In the past 5 years, all top WRU contenders produced at least one rookie with outstanding per game metrics.\",\n caption= \"Sources: College Football Fast R, Sports Reference | By Olivia Carnevale\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15.4, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this still doesn’t lead us to one direct answer for who is WRU. Sure, Ohio State pumps out draft picks, but LSU and USC are not far behind. The Buckeyes again produce the most consistent, great rookies, again, with USC narrowly behind. LSU, on the other hand, produces the biggest stars with Alabama and Ohio State showing strength in numbers.\nThis turns it to you, what do you value most for a WRU team? Is it producing a high quantity, not solely numbers, but of consistently strong NFL wide receivers? If so, your answer should be Ohio State. Is it producing superstars every few years? If so, then it’s LSU. Is it somewhere in the middle, leading to Alabama?\nI’m sure you can guess what my answer is, but for you, I’ll let the graphs do the talking."
